# Restaurant Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes restaurant data to gain insights into various aspects such as ratings, geographical distribution, cuisine popularity, and more. The analysis is divided into three main tasks:

*Data Exploration and Preprocessing

*Descriptive Analysis

*Geospatial Analysis

# Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Explore the dataset to identify the number of rows and columns.

Check for missing values in each column and handle them appropriately.

Perform data type conversion if necessary.

Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.

# Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.

Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."

Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

# Task 3: Geospatial Analysis
Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.

Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.

Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating

# Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder to perform the analysis.

Alternatively, execute the Python scripts in the scripts/ folder for specific tasks.
